  # Defining our fields with their types
  field :slug, type: String

  # Post document

  scope :ordered, -> { order('created_at DESC') }

  # Validates that the slug is present and unique
  validates :slug, presence: true, uniqueness: true

  # Also defining an index will make the query more efficient
